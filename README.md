# \<div\> block art
A fun thing I made to practice DOM manipulation with JavaScript.

Fun fact: the html \<body\> section for this is barely 8 lines:

```html
<header>
  <h1>&lt;div&gt; block art</h1>
  <p>Click on boxes to split them and randomize their color!</p>
</header>

<section>
  <div class="first art"></div>
</section>

<script src="div-art.js"></script>
```
Visit the **[web page here](https://ellenlloyd.ca/div-art/)** to try it out. It's strangely addicting!
